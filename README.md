# Acknowledgements

Originally forked from LondheShubham153/django-notes-app.

Huge thanks to Shubham Londhe bhiya for building the app and openâ€‘sourcing.

Using this project, which was originally created by Shubham Londhe bhaiya for learning purposes, I built a fully containerized environment with Docker and successfully deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster. It serves as a practical base to explore and implement modern DevOps practices, including Docker image creation, orchestration with Docker Compose, and scalable deployment using Kubernetes.

once again thanks to Shubham Londhe bhiya (trainwithshubham)
